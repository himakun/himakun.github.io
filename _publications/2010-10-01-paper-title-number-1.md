title: "Impact of Air Pollution on Subjective Well-Being and Health Behaviors: Evidence from a Cross-sectional Study in South Korea"
collection: working paper
permalink: /publication/2010-10-01-paper-title-number-1
excerpt: '*Abstract*: Exposure to air pollution is a potential threat to health and well-being. Controlling for time- invariant regional characteristics, we study the impacts of exposure to fine particulate matter(PM) on people’s health behaviors and subjective well-being. Ambient air pollution is found to be associated with lower life satisfaction, a higher likelihood of feeling stressed from health issues, and less value on health perception. More days with air pollution encourage people to exercise less and smoke often. The overall travel time spent on the road increases, taking longer to get to work when days with bad air quality increase. We disclose that the impact of air pollution could be unequal depending on whether one could reduce physical activity to mitigate the detrimental effect of pollution. Workers, especially in low-class elementary occupations, experience lower life satisfaction, and higher health stress.'
